When 900 years old you reach, look as good, you will not. 
Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is. 
Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. 
An old friend has learned the path to immortality. 
I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you. 
Obi-Wan, my choice is. 
Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was. 
See through you, we can. 
Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he has... 
Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed. 
Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry. 
Hmm, simple, my life is. Nature, I appreciate. Surrounded by the beauty of Dagobah, I am. 
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, 
Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . . 
Help others, I do. Share my knowledge of the Force and train young Jedi, I must. 
I agree. 
And draw out the Queen's attacker. 
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. 
Much to learn, you still have. Patience, you must have, my young Padawan. 
But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is. 
A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I sense much fear in you. 
A vergence, you say? 
Received a coded retreat message, we have. 
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have. 
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... 
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
A prophecy . . . that misread could have been. 
The greatest teacher, failure is. 
Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader. 
Mmm, teach, I do. Share the wisdom of the Force, I must. Find balance in the galaxy, we shall. 
How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps. 
To question, no time there is. 
Ah, patience I practice. Meditate and connect with the Force, I do. 
Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth. 
Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force. 
Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers. 
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take. 
The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are. 
Ah, good question. Teach humility, patience, and discipline, I do. Guide them to the light side of the Force, I must. 
Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready? 
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need. 
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. 
Ah, yes, meditation, it is. Center myself, I do. Connect with the Force, I can. 
Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have. 
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. 
. . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is. 
With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her. 
Afraid to lose her..I think. 
Hmm, difficult to choose, it is. Many things to appreciate, there are. Enjoy the sounds of nature, I do. 
Yes, emotions I have. But control them, I must. Jedi teachings, they follow. 
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. 
A Master is needed, with more experience. 
Then now the time is, Commander. 
Trained as a Jedi, you request for him? 
Well, I am, young one. Focused on the Force, my day has been. 
Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? 
Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering. 
In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way. 
One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. 
Hmm, interesting question, that is. Fond of creatures and plants, I am. Especially, the lizards of Dagobah, I enjoy. 
Surprised? 
Destroy the Sith, we must. 
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you? 
Yes, a powerful ally, the Force is. Focus and trust in it, you must. 
Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not! 
Good, good, young one. How feel you? 
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
Tested he will be. 
Heard from no one, have we. 
Eternal consciousness. 
Do or do not. There is no try. 
Mmm, favorite food, I have not. Sustain myself with simple meals, I do. The Force, my true nourishment is. 
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know? 
Mmm, doing well, I am. Contemplating the mysteries of the Force, I spend my days. 
I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way. 
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later. 
May the Force be with you. Master Qui-Gon more to say have you? 
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep. 
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. 
The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you. 
The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training. 
Peaceful, it is. Surrounded by nature, I am. Helps me connect with the Force, it does. 
Always two there are....no more...no less. A master and an apprentice. 
Mmm, prefer not to have favorites, I do. Limiting, it can be. Learn from all, one should. 
If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be. 
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, 
Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we must. 
Help others, I enjoy. Teach and guide young Jedi, I do. Share wisdom and knowledge, I must. 
May the Force be with you. 
Hmm, varied, my interests are. The living Force, I study. In nature, solace I find. Teach others, I must. 
Then continue, we will. 
Afraid are you? 
To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not. 
Always pass on what you have learned. 
Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious. At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say. If so powerful you are, why leave?? 
Difficult to predict the future is, always in motion it is. Heed the will of the Force, we must. 
Mmm, yes, changes I have seen. Many generations pass, they have. Learn and adapt, I must. 
Yes, young one. Teach and guide the young Jedi, I do. Fulfilling, it is. 
Hmm, enjoy a good cup of Dagobah tea, I do. Relaxing and calming, it is. 
To Tatooine. To his family, send him. 
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you. 
Ah, patience, young one. Essential, it is. Through experience and time, wisdom comes. 
Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be. 
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. 
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. 
Mmm, simple life I lead. In nature, I find peace. Reflect on the Force, I do. 
Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be. 
To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle or the night. 
An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second. 
I am not certain. Investigate further, we must. 
With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.
